\# Dynamic Resource Allocation System

\*(RABS-POC ‚Äï July 2025)\*



---



\## 1  System Overview \& Capabilities

RABS now moves from static rostering to an \*\*auto-orchestrated logistics engine\*\* that:



\* Calculates staff \& vehicle needs live from participant numbers

\* Chooses staff who still need contracted hours

\* Allocates 10-seater buses, preferring 5 clients per run for time efficiency

\* Calls Google Maps to build optimal pickup / drop-off routes

\* Reacts instantly to adds, cancels or leaves ‚Äì re-balancing staff, buses \& routes

\* Works for \*\*all\*\* programs (existing \& new) and is exposed through REST APIs \& a Dynamic Demo UI.



This delivers true intelligent resource allocation before any ML layer is applied.

\## 2  Technical Architecture



Component | Responsibility

---|---

`dynamicResourceService.js` | Core engine ‚Äì staffing, vehicle allocation, route optimisation, rebalancing

`routeOptimizationService.js` | Google Maps calls, distance matrix, polyline decode, traffic options

`dynamicResourceController.js` | Express controller wiring REST ‚Üí services

`dynamicResources.js` | Router (`/api/v1/dynamic-resources/\*`)

DB tables | `staff\_assignments`, `vehicle\_assignments`, `routes`, `route\_stops`, plus existing participants / attendance

Frontend ‚Äë React | `DynamicResourceDemo.jsx` page (map visualisation, live add/remove, rebalance, optimise)

Settings | `settings.google\_maps\_enabled` + `.env` keys



---



\## 3  How It Works  (End-to-End Flow)



1\. \*\*Participant change\*\* (add / cancel / leave) hits `POST /dynamic-resources/participant-change`.

2\. `dynamicResourceService.handleParticipantChange()` updates `attendance` then calls `rebalanceResources()`.

3\. `rebalanceResources()`

&nbsp;  a. Reads live participant list ‚Üí `calculateRequiredResources()`

&nbsp;  b. \*\*Staffing\*\* ‚Üí `allocateStaff()` (1:4 rule, picks staff with highest remaining hours)

&nbsp;  c. \*\*Vehicles\*\* ‚Üí `allocateVehicles()` (bus capacity logic)

&nbsp;  d. \*\*Routes\*\* ‚Üí `optimizeRoutes()` which groups riders per bus and invokes Google Maps Directions.

4\. New allocations stored in `staff\_assignments`, `vehicle\_assignments`, `routes`, `route\_stops`.

5\. Client UI polls `GET /dynamic-resources/status/:piId` or sockets (future) and redraws.

\## 4  API End-points



Method \& Path | Purpose

---|---

`GET  /dynamic-resources/status/:programInstanceId` | Current participant count, staff/vehicle requirement vs assigned, route count

`POST /dynamic-resources/rebalance/:programInstanceId` | Force full recalculation

`POST /dynamic-resources/participant-change` `{ participantId, programInstanceId, changeType }` | Add / cancel / leave triggers auto-rebalance

`POST /dynamic-resources/optimize-routes/:programInstanceId` | Re-run Google Maps optimisation only

`GET  /dynamic-resources/routes/:programInstanceId` | Detailed route + stops for map

`POST /dynamic-resources/programs` | Create \*\*dynamic\*\* program (repeat pattern, instances auto-generated)



All live under `/api/v1`.

\## 5  Demo Scenarios \& Usage



Scenario | What to do | Expected System Behaviour

---|---|---

Create ‚ÄúArt Therapy‚Äù | Use \*\*New Program\*\* form ‚Üí weekly Wed | 8 future instances generated, zero staff/vehicles until participants exist

Enroll participants 1-4 | In Demo page ‚ÄúAdd Participant‚Äù | On 4th enrolment staff required=1, auto-assigns staff S\* with greatest remaining hrs

Enroll participant 5 | Auto-assigns 2nd staff, allocates 1 bus, builds pickup route Green Valley ‚Üí venue

Scale to 35 | Continue adding ‚Üí system grows to 9 staff, 4 buses, multi-route optimisation

Cancel one client | Remove participant ‚Üí engine re-runs: maybe drops a bus, condenses routes

Click \*\*Rebalance Resources\*\* | Manual trigger | Forces immediate recalculation (useful after manual staff swap)

Click \*\*Optimize Routes\*\* | Re-optimises waypoints (e.g. after traffic spike)

\## 6  Google Maps Integration



Step | Detail

---|---

API key | `.env` ‚Üí `GOOGLE\_MAPS\_API\_KEY` (backend) \& `VITE\_GOOGLE\_MAPS\_API\_KEY` (frontend)

Enable | `settings.google\_maps\_enabled = 1` (done by `enableGoogleMaps.js`)

Geocoding | `batchGeocodeParticipants()` fills missing lat/lng

Directions | `Directions API` with `waypoints=optimize:true`

Traffic | Optional `departure\_time=now`, `traffic\_model=best\_guess`

Fallback | If API key absent, Haversine sorting is used (still demo-able offline)

\## 7  Auto-Staffing Rules



Rule | Implementation

---|---

Base ratio | \*\*1 staff : 4 participants\*\* ‚Äì ceiling division `Math.ceil(count/4)`

Lead assignment | First staff = `lead`, rest = `support`

Priority | Ordered by \*\*remaining contracted hours DESC\*\* so under-utilised staff fill first

Availability check | Cross-checked against `staff\_availability` day/time window

Transactions | All inserts in a single `BEGIN‚Ä¶COMMIT` to avoid UNIQUE violations



---



\## 8  Vehicle Allocation Logic



Constraint | Value

---|---

Vehicle type | 10-seater bus (9 clients + 1 driver)

Preferred load | \*\*5 participants\*\* per vehicle for faster runs

Hard cap | 9 participants max (safety margin)

Driver | Chosen from already assigned non-lead staff when possible

Availability | Vehicle free if no overlapping assignment on same date \& time window

Assignment table | `vehicle\_assignments` (links driver \& program\_instance)

\## 9  Route Optimisation Features



Feature | Description

---|---

Grouping | Participants divided across vehicles (target 5/vehicle) before optimisation

Optimiser | Google Maps Directions `optimize:true` returns waypoint order

Duration \& Distance | Stored in `routes` (minutes, km)

Stops | Saved in `route\_stops` with ETA back-calculated from program start (pickup) or end (drop-off)

Polylines | Encoded polyline returned for frontend map overlay

Re-optimisation | Triggered automatically on participant change or via `/optimize-routes`

\### üöÄ  Why It Matters

Without any AI layer we already:

‚Ä¢ Cut coordinator workload (no manual counts)

‚Ä¢ Guarantee ratio compliance \& NHVAS capacity limits

‚Ä¢ Produce driver run-sheets instantly

‚Ä¢ Adapt live to cancellations



Add your future ‚ÄúBrainframe‚Äù NL reasoning on top and the system will not only react, it will \*\*predict\*\* and \*\*negotiate\*\* ‚Äì but the intelligent foundation is now in place.
