\# RABS-POC: Business Rules Engine



This document details the specific, hardcoded business logic that drives the RABS-POC.

\## 1. Staffing Rules



The primary rule for staffing allocation is based on the number of confirmed participants for a given program instance.



\*   \*\*Staffing Ratio:\*\* 1 staff member is required for every 4 participants.

\*   \*\*Calculation:\*\* `staffNeeded = ceil(participantCount / 4)`

\*   \*\*Implementation:\*\* This calculation is triggered whenever an enrollment changes (add, confirm, cancel). The `dynamicResourceService.js` is responsible for this logic.

\*   \*\*Assignment Priority:\*\* When assigning staff, the system prioritizes staff members with the most remaining contracted hours to ensure equitable work distribution.

\## 2. Vehicle Allocation Rules



Vehicle allocation aims for both capacity satisfaction and time efficiency.



\*   \*\*Vehicle Capacity:\*\* All vehicles are 10-seater buses (1 driver + 9 passengers).

\*   \*\*Preferred Load:\*\* For efficiency, the system prefers a load of \*\*5 participants\*\* per vehicle. If a run has 8 participants, it will try to use two smaller, faster runs of 4 participants each rather than one large, slow run, provided the staffing ratio is still met.

\*   \*\*Hard Cap:\*\* A single bus will never be allocated more than 9 participants.

\*   \*\*Driver Assignment:\*\* The driver is chosen from the already-assigned staff members, prioritizing non-lead staff where possible.

\## 3. Cancellation \& Billing Rules



The system distinguishes between normal and short-notice cancellations, which has a direct impact on billing.



\*   \*\*Notice Period:\*\* A cancellation is considered \*\*"short notice"\*\* if it occurs \*\*less than 7 days\*\* before the scheduled program instance.

\*   \*\*Normal Cancellation (â‰¥ 7 days notice):\*\*

&nbsp;   \*   The participant's `attendance` record is deleted.

&nbsp;   \*   Any associated un-billed items are voided.

&nbsp;   \*   The participant is billed \*\*0%\*\*.

\*   \*\*Short-Notice Cancellation (< 7 days notice):\*\*

&nbsp;   \*   The participant's `attendance` record status is set to `'cancelled'`.

&nbsp;   \*   The billing records are \*\*retained\*\*. The participant is billed as if they attended.

&nbsp;   \*   The `POC\_NEXT\_STEPS.md` document mentions a potential 90% billing rule, but the implemented logic in `REFINEMENTS\_COMPLETED.md` clarifies that the session is still billed fully.

\*   \*\*Audit Trail:\*\* All cancellations are logged in the `activity\_log` table for auditing purposes.

\## 4. Routing Logic



\*   \*\*Primary Engine:\*\* Google Maps Directions \& Distance Matrix APIs are used if a valid API key is provided in the `.env` file. The optimizer is used to determine the most efficient waypoint order (`waypoints=optimize:true`).

\*   \*\*Fallback Engine:\*\* If Google Maps keys are absent, the system falls back to a simpler calculation using a nearest-neighbor algorithm and Haversine distance to order the stops.

\*   \*\*Max Ride Time:\*\* The system is intended to respect a 60-minute maximum ride time from the last pickup to the venue, which influences the decision to use multiple smaller buses.
