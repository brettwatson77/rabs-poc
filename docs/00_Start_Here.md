\# Welcome to the RABS-POC Documentation



This documentation hub contains the complete history, architectural vision, and implementation details for the \*\*RABS Proof-of-Concept (rabs-poc)\*\* project.



\## Reading Guide



If you are new to the project, we recommend reading the documents in the following order to understand our vision, architecture, and progress.



\### 1. Project Vision and Architecture

This is the core of the RABS project. It explains the "why" and "how" of our system.



\*   \*\*\[01\_RABS\_Architectural\_Blueprint.md](./01\_Project\_Vision\_and\_Architecture/01\_RABS\_Architectural\_Blueprint.md)\*\*: The foundational document explaining our "Rules, Overrides, and Projections" model.

\*   \*\*\[02\_Core\_Concepts\_Deep\_Dive.md](./01\_Project\_Vision\_and\_Architecture/02\_Core\_Concepts\_Deep\_Dive.md)\*\*: A detailed exploration of the metaphors (Loom, History Ribbon) that guide our design.

\*   \*\*\[03\_Dynamic\_Resource\_System.md](./01\_Project\_Vision\_and\_Architecture/03\_Dynamic\_Resource\_System.md)\*\*: A deep dive into our intelligent resource allocation engine.



\### 2. Proof of Concept Journey

This section contains the historical documents that chart the evolution of the rabs-poc, from initial ideas to implemented features.



\*   \*\*\[01\_POC\_Specification.md](./02\_Proof\_of\_Concept\_Journey/01\_POC\_Specification.md)\*\*: The original requirements for the proof-of-concept.

\*   \*\*\[02\_POC\_Development\_Plan.md](./02\_Proof\_of\_Concept\_Journey/02\_POC\_Development\_Plan.md)\*\*: The phased development plan created for the POC.

\*   \*\*\[03\_POC\_Next\_Steps\_Roadmap.md](./02\_Proof\_of\_Concept\_Journey/03\_POC\_Next\_Steps\_Roadmap.md)\*\*: The detailed, task-oriented roadmap for specific features like Cancellations and Billing.

\*   \*\*\[04\_POC\_Implementation\_Log.md](./02\_Proof\_of\_Concept\_Journey/04\_POC\_Implementation\_Log.md)\*\*: A combined log of features and refinements implemented in July 2025.



\### 3. Development and Operations

This section contains the practical information needed to set up and work with the POC.



\*   \*\*\[01\_Technology\_Stack\_and\_Setup.md](./03\_Development\_and\_Operations/01\_Technology\_Stack\_and\_Setup.md)\*\*: A guide to the tech stack, project structure, and setup instructions.

\*   \*\*\[02\_API\_Reference.md](./03\_Development\_and\_Operations/02\_API\_Reference.md)\*\*: A summary of the key API endpoints available in the POC.

\*   \*\*\[03\_Billing\_and\_Rules\_Engine.md](./03\_Development\_and\_Operations/03\_Billing\_and\_Rules\_Engine.md)\*\*: Details on the specific business rules for billing and staffing.



\### 4. Future Vision

This section contains forward-looking ideas and proposals for the future of the RABS platform.



\*   \*\*\[01\_Enhancement\_Proposals.md](./04\_Future\_Vision/01\_Enhancement\_Proposals.md)\*\*: A vision for extending the POC's foundational elements into a comprehensive SaaS application.
